# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Implement playback
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings
 - Keyboard press settings implementation
 - Application settings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Playback not yet implemented, but in next commit it will be
  - Added logger listbox but not functional
  - Moved playback delay setting to logger section, as that's actually where playback settings will be

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
