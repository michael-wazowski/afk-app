# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Implement playback
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings
 - Keyboard press settings implementation
 - Application settings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - I lied. Playback still not yet implemented, aiming to be done next commit
  - Redid formatting of area above logger, added some more playback settings
  - Didn't put here last commit, but sample idea for save/load of keypress recording config

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
