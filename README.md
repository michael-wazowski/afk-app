# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application.

### TODO:
 - Create simple interface to select app/window to afk on
 - Implement keypress recording for afk playback

 ### Changelog
  - Started class-based development
  - Moved getForegroundWindow function into class as it needed no changes
  - Created basic listbox to hold applications (not yet functional)

Overall afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
