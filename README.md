# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Implement keypress recording for afk playback
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Rudimentary keypress recording implemented
  - Playback not yet implemented, as processing post-recording isn't done yet
  - Not actually sure how to process recordings yet, as recorded strokes are not always in order of action by user

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
