# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings
 - Keyboard press settings implementation
 - Application settings
 - Refactor recording related code into new class

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Playback now uses config set up by user
  - Changed playback delay input to incrementation widget, and is validated in the same way as loop limit
  - Live log not implemented yet, but space has been allocated for it

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
