# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application.

### TODO:
 - Create simple interface to select app/window to afk on
 - Implement keypress recording for afk playback

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Added refresh button to update apps list
  - Fixed minor bug where list would include afk app in list

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
