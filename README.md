# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Implement keypress recording for afk playback
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Added basic UI widgets for key press recording and clearing
  - Button methods are dummy at the moment, with messageboxes informing such
  - Delay isn't used yet, but is intended for delay between playbacks of recording (in seconds)

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
