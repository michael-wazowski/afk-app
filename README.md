# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Implement playback
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings
 - Keyboard press settings implementation
 - Application settings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Added UI zeroing checkbox, currently just appearance, not a functionality add-on
  - Playback not yet implemented, hopefully partly or completely done next update (I understand how the keyboard events work now)
  - Added and changed some items in the TODO list, some of which are a long way off from being started

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
