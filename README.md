# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

## TODO:
 - Implement save of keyboard recordings
 - Keyboard press settings implementation
 - Application settings

## CHANGE LOG:
 - Started some ideal functions for future features, they hardly do anything though
 - Implemented keyboard recording load. They *can* be used for playback
 - Saving not done yet, will come next. For now, use only example to create manual "recordings" to load in
