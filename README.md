# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Implement playback - with config
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings
 - Keyboard press settings implementation
 - Application settings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Playback is in! However, it ignores user config, which should come in next commit
  - Loop limit validates input so text isn't allowed anymore, will make this change for playback delay too
  - Added to example config yaml and commented it

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
