# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application window.

### TODO:
 - Implement keypress recording for afk playback
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - Implemented pop-up window when recording keyboard
  - Can only be closed by stopping the recording
  - No functionality yet, all UI implementation

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
