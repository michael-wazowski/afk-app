# AFK App
Application that takes keyboard inputs to automate and run for you on a selected application.

### TODO:
 - Implement keypress recording for afk playback
 - Add live log to show pause/unpause times
 - Implement save/load of keyboard recordings

 ### CHANGE LOG:
  - In previous commit but: Refactored code to populate apps list
  - Minor changes to interface to be grid-based, added label to list

Overall: afk app is not yet functional, but is making progress
